[Hit] Take one additional card. You can take up to six additional cards[x01]

You will play a one-on-one game of poker against Jack using[x01]
unconventional rules. In this game, there are three 'table cards' in the[x01]
center of the table that players include in their hands.[x01][x01]
Both players are given three cards at the start of the turn, then they[x01]
eventually choose five of the three cards in their hand and three on the[x01]
table to make a hand.[x01][x01]
Both players attempt to steal the other's stars, and the first player to[x01]
reach seven stars wins. The player starts with three, while Jack has four.[x01]
Losing all of your stars will result in defeat.[x01]

An urgent report came in from Haliask Cathedral in[x01]
the then-principality (now a state) of North Ambria[x01]
in northern Zemuria.[x02][x01]

It stated that a giant white pillar 'so tall it appears to[x01]

Bishop Alexei, the one who sent the report, behaved[x01]

By urgent order of the committee, two knights of the[x01]

[x07][x00]#2SThe spread of that salinification process was startlingly[x01]

By the time the Gralsritter arrived, the entire landscape[x01]

had already been lost.[x02]

AnonymousTalk #158


[x07][x00]#2SYet the spread did not stop there.[x02][x03]

A day after the Salt Pale first appeared, a vast coniferous[x01]
forest zone north of the capital crystallized and collapsed.[x02][x01]

Bridges also collapsed, rendering all of the main highways[x01]
out of the city unusable.[x02][x01]

Please note that by this point, then-ruler Prince Balmund[x01]
had already fled the country to a nearby nation.[x02][x01]








Two days passed since the pale's appearance...[x02][x01]

By this point, roughly half of the entire principality had[x01]
become a sea of salt.[x02][x01]

Countless refugees had fled to the southern side of the[x01]
country because the River Greve stood between it and the[x01]
affected area.[x02][x01]

Finally, three days after the pale's appearance...[x02][x01]



The salinification process stopped at dawn. As a result,[x01]
the knights were able to advance on the capital of Haliask[x01]
with the hope of investigating the Salt Pale.[x02]

Its surface was no longer blanketed in salt. Rather,[x01]
it looked as if something had been carved out of it.[x02][x01]





It is now believed that the pale's mass decreased[x01]
as the salinification process progressed.[x02]

turn swathes of the country to salt, but its ability[x01]
to salinify was still very much intact.[x02][x01]

Anything that touched it, even for a millisecond,[x01]
was instantaneously turned into salt. It was of the[x01]
utmost importance to handle it with care.[x02][x01]








In order to complete the mission without physical[x01]
contact, the Gralsritter required the of use the[x01]
sacred tool Gleipnir, which was delivered to them[x01]
from the High Seat in Arteria.[x02][x01]

Since then, it has been kept closely sealed away[x01]
deep within the High Seat in Arteria.[x02]

No damage to the surrounding nations was reported,[x01]
but it resulted in the destruction of three of the five[x01]
administrative districts of the principality, including[x01]
its capital.[x02][x01]

Over a third of the total population, along with[x01]
travelers from elsewhere, lost their lives.[x02][x01]







This is to say nothing of the emotional damage[x01]
caused; due to its sudden outbreak, the hearts of[x01]
North Ambria's people were overwhelmed with fear[x01]

a swift response from the Septian Church was all[x01]

[x07][x00]#2SSupplementary Notes:[x02][x01]

After some time, the country's former leader,[x01]
Prince Balmunt, attempted to rebuild the [x01]
government...[x02][x01]

but given that he had fled the country during[x01]
its hour of need, caring only for himself and not[x01]
his people, all authority he once had was gone.[x02][x01]







The following year, the country's people led an[x01]
armed uprising, and the Principality of North[x01]
Ambria was no more.[x02][x01]

Eventually elections were held, and the country[x01]
became a democracy, thus bringing about the[x01]
birth of the autonomous state we know of now.[x02]

[x07][x00]#2SThis was also when the former principality's[x01]
armed forces reformed as a vigilante corps.[x02][x01]

Given the extreme poverty of the state, however,[x01]
the majority of said corps considered gathering[x01]
foreign currency to be of the utmost importance.[x02][x01]

This was how the large-scale jaeger corps known[x01]

AnonymousTalk #167


[x07][x00]#2SPerhaps the most obvious of these is where it[x01]
came from.[x02][x01]

Despite the considerable size of the object and[x01]
that it appeared on the outskirts of a populated[x01]
city, no information is available regarding the[x01]
moment it first appeared.[x02][x01]

The most popular theory is that its appearance was[x01]
due to something akin to spatial translocation, [x01]
but no hard evidence exists to support this--or any[x01]
other--theory.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #168


[x07][x00]#2SOf more importance, however, is its positioning in[x01]
the teachings of the Septian Church.[x02][x01]

The pale is clearly different in nature to artifacts,[x01]
and appears to be a more fundamental[x01]
'manifestation of the Goddess' powers of creation'[x01]
(committee report).[x02][x01]

With the limits of our knowledge at present, this is[x01]
as far as we can get to the truth.[x02][x01]

There are some who have proposed it may be one[x01]
of the Sept-Terrions, but no evidence has been[x01]
found in legend or scripture to support this belief.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[x07][x00]#2SNevertheless, these questions and many others need[x01]
answering, and the Congregation for the Sacraments[x01]
continues to study the Salt Pale to this day.[x02][x01]

The most accepted proposal comes from those who[x01]
believe the pale should be seen as nothing more than[x01]
a gift from Aidios, and they continue to consider[x01]
various means for Her church to make good use of it.[x02]

AnonymousTalk #170


[x07][x00]#2SThe most realistic of these plans is using it in the[x01]
manufacture of a sacred tool used for execution.[x02][x01]

Parts of the pale are cut away using high-pressure[x01]
water and then surrounded with a cylinder made[x01]
from salt crystal, allowing them to be fired directly[x01]
into the target without requiring the user to make[x01]
direct contact. [x02][x01]

Should the bolt make successfully contact with a[x01]
human target, their whole body would turn to salt,[x01]
killing them in mere seconds.[x02][x01]

There are no known means for reversing or stopping[x01]
the process.[x02]

unwise to be careless with an object we still do not[x01]

There are also humanitarian concerns with executing[x01]
someone in this manner.[x02][x01]

Still, it does bear mentioning that should there ever[x01]
be a case where a target needs to be eliminated[x01]
without fail, this would be the most surefire way to[x01]
carry it out.[x02]

AnonymousTalk #179


[x07][x00]Phantom Thief B has had quite the lengthy and[x01]
productive career in thievery in the Empire, [x01]
as the amount of records we have been able to[x01]
find on his crimes proves beyond a doubt.[x02][x01]

From numerous paintings held in the Imperial Art [x01]
Gallery...[x02][x01]

to a septium crystal held in the Empire's customs [x01]
warehouse...[x02][x01]

to even a cutting-edge tank held in an[x01]
Imperial Army research facility...[x02][x01]

Nothing is truly safe when he desires to steal it.[x02][x01]

His conquests aren't limited to inanimate objects;[x01]
he has been guilty of pretending to be a military[x01]
officer and eloping with the wife of a marquis on[x01]
one reported occasion.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #180


[x07][x00]Yet--and this is perhaps the most baffling part--[x01]
there is no concrete evidence to suggest he has[x01]
profited from his exploits. [x02][x01]

Rather, the objects stolen usually end up in places[x01]
so bizarre, their owners are liable to faint upon[x01]
hearing about them.[x02][x01]


In other cases, they are transformed into mira[x01]
which is then rained down from the sky in areas[x01]
largely inhabited by those less fortunate.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #181


[x07][x00]Hearing this, one might be led to think him[x01]
a vigilante thief who takes from the rich and[x01]
giving to the poor.[x02][x01]

But make no mistake, the truth is not so simple.[x02][x01]

The wife of the marquis discussed earlier is a[x01]
fine example of that.[x02][x01]

As of this writing, it has been a little over half a[x01]
year since the elopement took place. Since then,[x01]
she has remained unaccounted for.[x02][x01]

Many of the items stolen by him may return to[x01]
the public eye in some fashion, but not all.[x02]

[x07][x00]Between his eccentric techniques and bizarre behavior[x01]

though his thefts are purely whims and nothing else.[x02][x01]

Upon studying the overall picture and reviewing the[x01]
objects--and indeed, people--in play, you begin to[x01]
see that they all have one specific thing in common.[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #183


[x07][x00]Take the artworks stolen from the Imperial Art Gallery,[x01]
for example. Each of them were works of pure genius,[x01]
painted by a master of their craft...[x02][x01]

but they gained a reputation for being too complex[x01]
for the target audience of such works--the nobility--[x01]
and were shamefully stored away instead of placed on[x01]
display.[x02][x01]







Similar could be said of the septium crystal. Known for[x01]
its unparalleled beauty, after being seized by customs,[x01]
it was sealed away in the warehouse and doomed never[x01]
to be admired by human eyes again.[x02][x01]

The tank, again, is one more example, with its promising[x01]
development cut short. Rather than be put to good use,[x01]
it was left collecting dust.[x02][x03]

As an aside, the case of the marquis' wife does contain[x01]
some striking similarities.[x02][x01]

Despite marrying her, he devoted most of his attention[x01]
to his concubines and barely spared a thought for her.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #184


[x07][x00]In conclusion, we can see now that the underlying motive[x01]
for his actions is finding objects of beauty that have been[x01]
abandoned by the world and freeing them from their foolish[x01]
owners.[x02][x01]

No matter how the world may see his crimes,[x01]
his motive is clear.[x02][x01]

The truth of that is evident in the cards he leaves[x01]
before committing his crimes.[x02][x01]

This is the so-called 'liberation of beauty' mentioned[x01]
upon each of them.[x02][x01]

Phantom Thief B steals not for money, but for an[x01]
ideal he believes in.[x02][x01]

...And it is in this fact, we believe, are clues to his[x01]
true identity.[x02]

AnonymousTalk #187


[x07][x00][X's Personal History][x02][x01]







X is known for his exceptional skill as a con artist,[x01]
having faked his own identity in order to engage in[x01]
romantic relationships with many noblewomen.[x02][x01]

He was as handsome as he was capable, and he was[x01]
exceptionally proud in nature as well.[x02][x01]








Born to a poor family in the temperate south, he[x01]
became used to stealing in order to make ends meet[x01]
from a young age.[x02][x01]

According to testimony from a companion of his at[x01]
the time, he was never once caught for such thefts.[x02]



;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #188


[x07][x00]The reason X converted from being a common thief[x01]
to a con artist is believed to have stemmed from[x01]
falling in love with a noblewoman of much higher[x01]
social standing than he.[x02][x01]

The rule of the aristocracy was absolute in the[x01]
country he called home, and blessed romances[x01]
between those of different classes unthinkable.[x02][x01]

With that in mind, he resolved to create a false[x01]
identity in order to make his dream possible.[x02][x01]







Following his first rousing success, he came to[x01]
do the same on a myriad of other occasions,[x01]
indulging in one forbidden affair after another.[x02][x01]

It was a mere ten years ago that he was arrested[x01]
on suspicion of identity fraud, but he performed[x01]
a miraculous escape from prison. Ever since then,[x01]
his whereabouts have remained unknown.[x02]

[x07][x00][Thoughts][x02][x01]







Both X's peerless skills as a thief [x02]

and his interest[x01]
in forbidden romances with noblewomen [x02]

sound[x01]
remarkably like what we know of Phantom Thief B.[x02][x01]

Also worth noting is that despite using his abilities[x01]
of deception to court those of vast wealth,[x01]
he displayed virtually no interest in their fortunes.[x02][x01]

That is to say, he gained no financial benefit from[x01]
his actions whatsoever.[x02][x01]








Instead, he simply lamented that he was unable to[x01]
indulge in them because of something as trivial as[x01]
his social class.[x02][x01]

We conclude that this attitude bears a striking[x01]
resemblance to the thief's own views on beauty.[x02]

[x07][x00][Y's Personal History][x02][x01]







Y was an artist with a rather tragic past.[x02][x01]

Born to a middle-class family in the north, he was[x01]
hired by an influential aristocrat to be their personal[x01]
artist, producing many a stunning piece of work.[x02][x01]


However, it was later discovered that wasn't all he[x01]
produced; on the contrary, he was also responsible[x01]
for a number of counterfeit pieces.[x02][x01]

The one who hired him sought to profit through ill[x01]
means thanks to his work, and so he created such[x01]
counterfeits under the noble's instructions.[x02][x01]







One day, however, Y suddenly left the noble's [x01]
service.[x02][x01]

(The reason remains unknown.)[x02][x01]

This is where his tragedy begins.[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AnonymousTalk #192


[x07][x00]Immediately after leaving his client behind...[x02][x01]

Y received a terrible piece of news: his lover,[x01]
the daughter of a respected family, had been[x01]
killed in a traffic accident.[x02][x01]

While there is no evidence to prove as much,[x01]
it is rumored that the noble may have had a[x01]
hand in her death.[x02][x01]








Y was only spotted once more at his lover's grave[x01]
before forever disappearing from the public eye.[x01]
To those who knew his story, he became known as[x01]
the truly tragic artist.[x02][x01]

Several years later, the noble was murdered.[x02]

AnonymousTalk #193


[x07][x00][Thoughts][x02][x01]







The story of Y still has several unsolved mysteries[x01]
surrounding it and has invited much speculation,[x01]
both of which have likely led to the theory that he[x01]
and Phantom Thief B are one and the same.[x02][x01]

Those aren't the only reasons, naturally.[x02][x01]


Phantom Thief B has been known, at times, to try[x01]
and dispose of counterfeits, believing them to be[x01]
'false beauty.'[x02][x01]







This has led some to believe that Phantom Thief B[x01]
may be attempting to rid the world of counterfeits[x01]
that he himself created.[x02][x01]



Lending further credibility to this is the discovery[x01]
that the forgeries disposed of by Phantom Thief B[x01]
were indeed the works of Y.[x02]

The story of Z is significantly different from the[x01]

Z was born in the far East as the son of a famed[x01]

He was an attractive, delicately-built young man,[x01]

[x07][x00]Z was indeed blessed in nearly every way. He came[x01]

He hardly kept such thoughts to himself--in fact,[x01]
he often voiced his complaints to anyone within[x01]
earshot.[x02][x01]

These complaints persisted until one day, he simply[x01]

Still, the idea that the man beneath the mask is one[x01]
