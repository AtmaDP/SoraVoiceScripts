[x07][x05]Some time had passed since the crisis involving[x01]
the Aureole came to an end.[x02][x03]

One by one, many of those who fought to bring it[x01]
to an end set off from the land of Liberl to [x01]
begin new lives...[x02][x03]

And today, yet another of their group was ready[x01]
to leave the kingdom behind as well.[x02]

#1100FI-I can't believe that you...[x02][x03]

I mean, my deepest apologies for not noticing that[x01]
you were His Highness Prince Olivert sooner![x02][x03]

While I may not have had the opportunity to see[x01]
you in public before now, I realize that is no[x01]
excuse... I do hope you will forgive my ignorance.[x02]

#030F#5PHaha. There's no need to be so apologetic, [x01]
Ambassador.[x02][x03]

If anyone deserves to be blamed here, it's me for[x01]
falsifying my identity, and not you.[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1100FI-I thank you for your mercy...[x02][x03]

Still, I can hardly believe that you went so far[x01]
just to come here and enjoy yourself.[x02][x03]

It's just as well you came out of it all safely,[x01]
or this could have become a major international[x01]
incident.[x02][x03]

I dread to think what would have happened to me[x01]
in that case... You were really playing with [x01]
fire this time, Your Highness.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#030F#5PHeh. Still, thanks to that, I was able to get the[x01]
kind of firsthand knowledge about this country[x01]
that no amount of books could have given me.[x02][x03]

Regardless, this won't be the last this country[x01]
sees of me, so I hope I'll be able to count on[x01]
you on future visits, too.[x02]

#1100FWh-What?![x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#030F#5PPerhaps next time I could even involve you more[x01]
directly in the proceedings. What say you to a[x01]
little hot springs trip together?[x02][x03]

Heh. We could even invite Ambassador Cochrane to[x01]
join us.[x02]

#1100FY-Your Highness...[x02]

#270F#2P*cough* Ambassador, if I may...[x02][x03]

Please don't take every one of his worthless jokes[x01]
at face value, or this meeting will take the rest[x01]
of the day.[x02][x03]

I think it would be best to get right to the point[x01]
and discuss the request regarding our return home[x01]
that we made  earlier.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #9

#1100FY-Yes, of course... I'll arrange an airship at[x01]
once.[x02][x03]

I should be able to have one of the high-speed[x01]
airships for diplomats arranged for tomorrow.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #10

#030F#5PHeh. You have our thanks.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #11
0x12

#1100FIt's an honor to be able to do anything to help[x01]
you, Your Highness.[x02][x03]

Besides, I think you're right that in these times,[x01]
returning on a military airship would be an unwise[x01]
move...[x02][x03]

Especially with how tense the situation at the[x01]
border is...[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#270F#6PSo, regarding what the ambassador said...[x02][x03]

What exactly is it that you're on the alert for?[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #13

#030F#2PHeh. I just want to avoid the possibility of any[x01]
unfortunate accidents.[x02][x03]

What I did will have caused the hawk faction in[x01]
the Empire to completely lose face.[x02][x03]

There's just no telling what they'll choose to do.[x02]


;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #14

#270F#6PIn other words...[x02][x03]

You think there's a possibility that there may be[x01]
an attempt on your life disguised as an accident?[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#030F#2PMy instinct is that the chancellor is far too [x01]
patient a man to try doing something so rash.[x02][x03]

Still, if I was in his position, I can't deny the[x01]
possibility I may try to use this opportunity.[x02][x03]

Once that thought occurred to me, no precaution[x01]
seemed too great, I suppose.[x02]

#270F#6P...[x02][x03]

The 7th Armored Division I serve is your ally,[x01]
as you well know.[x02][x03]

If anything were to happen, they would be right[x01]
there for you.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #17
0x11

#030F#2PWell, that's certainly reassuring to know...[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #18
0x11

#030F#2PBut as I'm sure you know, acting rashly in the[x01]
current situation is just what our enemy would[x01]
want us to do.[x02][x03]

It's similar to street fights in a sense -- the[x01]
first one to draw their weapon is the one in the[x01]
wrong.[x02][x03]

If I decide to rely on brute force, they'll have[x01]
every reason to decry me as a rebellious traitor.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #19

#270F#6PI suppose you're right...[x02][x03]

Sometimes trying too hard to defend yourself can[x01]
end up cornering you instead.[x02][x03]

Perhaps sometimes the best method of self-defense[x01]
is to do nothing at all.[x02]

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChrTalk #20

#030F#2PHeh. Indeed.[x02][x03]

As long as our enemy doesn't know what we plan to[x01]
do, they can't do anything to counter it, either.[x02][x03]

First, we need to return to Heimdallr and tell[x01]
His Majesty the truth of all that happened here.[x02][x03]


We can decide what we're going to after seeing[x01]
what kind of a reaction we get.[x02]
